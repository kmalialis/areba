Consider the circle with equation (x - x0)^2 + (y - y0)^2 = r^2 where

the origin is (x0,y0)=(0.4, 0.5)
the radius is r=0.2
and x, y in [0,1]

Points within the circle are positive (y=1) and outside the circle are negative (y=0).

The dataset contains 10K instances from each class.

There is no need for data preprocessing.

Created by the code in data_generate_circle.py.
